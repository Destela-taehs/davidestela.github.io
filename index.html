        <h1> Hello readers, my name is David-Daniel Estela and I'd ike to welcome you to my portfolio </h1>
        
        <ha2> Heres a little bit about who I am: </h2>
        
        <p>
            I like to skateboard, I dont do any cool tricks, I just tend to cruise around. I love photography but I dont take many pictures because I'm a perfectionist so I wait till I can find a "perfect" picture for whichever moment is current. I like gaming, mainly action and free-roam games because to me they feel like a distraction from reality. I'm not someone that likes a lot of social interraction and I tend to get very tired or "drained" around majority of people so I mainly keep to myself only, if I can, while only keeping certain/few peers around me. Lastly, i use drawing(s), photography, music, and writting to express myself when I feel I can or am able to.
